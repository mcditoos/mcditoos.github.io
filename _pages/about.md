I just finished my master's at CINVESTAV. I'm interested in quantum resource theories, dynamical systems and AI both from a theoretical and experimental point of view. On my spare time I love cooking, languages and karaoke. I made this website as a first attempt to try to promote myself more. I was raised on the idea that this sort of stuff were pretentious and only done by people who needed to sell an image because they had nothing more, but now I've come to realize that this sort of space to show people your work and interests can be extremely helpful when looking for a job. I'm on the lookout for an internship to contribute to open source since it is something I've been wanting to do for long now, also looking for a PhD.
